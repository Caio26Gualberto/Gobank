# 🏦 GoBank - Simple Banking API in Golang

This is a simple banking API developed in Go — created with the goal of refreshing my knowledge of the language and reinforcing backend fundamentals such as:

- Structs and interfaces
- HTTP routing and handlers
- Middleware
- Clean architecture
- Database access with SQL
- Error handling and validation

## 📚 What is this project?

GoBank simulates a very basic banking system. It allows:

- Creating, listing, updating and deleting bank accounts
- Creating and listing transactions linked to an account

> This is not a production-grade app. It's intentionally simple to be easy to understand and a good starting point for learning Go.
